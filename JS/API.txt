ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF API's

1. REST (Representational State Transfer) can be compared to a waiter who goes to the kitchen(server) and gets food(data) for you 
    - A simple way for applications to talk with each other over the internet
    - It uses http methods like GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
    - REST API's are stateless that means the server does not remember your previous state, every request has all the information required for prossesing the request
    - REST is platform independent, mobile apps, ios apps, web apps all can talk with the same REST server
    - Not good for bank transfer and enterprise systems 

2. SOAP (Simple object access protocol) If REST is like a casual phone call SOAP is like a formal business contract
    - Strict rules
    - Very specific structure
    - Protocol independent
    - Built in mechanisms for error handling, security and transactional support

3. gRPC (Google Remote Procedural Call)
    - Instead of sending data between server, our app on one server can all the function present on some other function
    - Transfers data in compact binary format(lightning fast to process) instead of json objects used in REST
    - 4 powerful communication patterns
        - Simple request - response just like REST
        - Server streaming for live updates 
        - Client streaming for sending continuous data
        - Bi-directional streaming, where both sides can chat at once in real time
    - 7-10 times faster than REST API's 

4. GraphQL (Graph Query Language)
    - REST causes overfetching or underfetching of data which is solved by graphQL as it sends only the data asked by the Client

5. Webhooks 
    - When we get the data when something changes in the backend without calling it from the frontend (like notification service)
    - Most used for automating systems or keep the system in sync

6. Websockets
    - Its like creating a connection between the client and server, once the connection is established then they can communicate bidirectionally with each other
    - Starts with a handshake (Browser sends a special http request asking to upgrade the connection to websockets)

7. WebRTC (Web real time communication)
    - Full framework the enables peer to peer communication
    - Data does not have to float through servers 
    - Usecases include: video streaming, gaming, screen sharing etc
